Tutorials (plan: Admin Dashboard):

2. Installing METEOR and creating a simple project
	- meteor create --typescript project name
	- Show all the folders and files in the generated project
	- Delete tests folder
    - Delete test folder link from package.json
3. Add proper typescript support and implement router (https://github.com/WeebNetsu/meteor-typescript-template)
	- cp -R ../meteor-typescript-template/typings/ .
	- cp -R ../meteor-typescript-template/imports/types ./imports/
	- npm install antd @ant-design/icons
	- mention https://docs.meteor.com/packages/accounts-ui.html (we will not be using it)
	- Delete hello and info .tsx files
	- Fix app.tsx to be a default export and fix main.tsx to reflect that
	- Delete everyting in api/ folder
	- Delete everything inside server/main.ts
	- Create HomePage folder and file
	- Create NotFoundPage folder and file
	- Create LoginPage folder and file (no styling needed yet)
	- Install wouter meteor npm i wouter (react router has issues in meteor)
	- Add accounts-password package (to see if user is logged in and later to help them log in)
	- Create routes.tsx file and add routes (order matters)
	- Add routes to App.tsx (note that we do not use route renderer yet)
